# Markov-Processes
This is a Markov Processes Simulations repository, where you can explore fundamental concepts in stochastic processes through practical simulations. This repository contains Python programs for simulating three classic problems:
1. Ising Model in a 2-D Lattice using Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm
2. Gambler's Ruin
3. Brownian Motion for a System of Particles
